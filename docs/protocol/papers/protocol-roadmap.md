# Protocol Roadmap

Chain Protocol 1 is aimed at laying a foundation for future upgrades and large-scale deployment, so that more sophisticated security and confidentiality features can be introduced in later releases. Updates to the protocol are intended to be deployed as [soft forks](whitepaper.md#8-extensibility) therefore keeping it compatible with the already deployed software and applications. 

**Disclaimer:** this roadmap does not represent a commitment to specific features, deadlines or order of implementation. It also mostly focuses on protocol-level features and does not cover specific improvements to Chain Core or any additional software. Those are discussed separately in the [Product Roadmap](../../core/reference/product-roadmap.md).

## Denial of service mitigation

* Explicit limits on number and size of blockchain entities (size of the blocks, number  of transactions etc).
* Fine-tuned runtime cost limits for the control and issuance programs.
* Improvemenets to consensus algorithm.

## Privacy

* Homomorphically encrypted amounts and asset identifiers to provide secrecy for balances and financial parameters of the transactions.
* Controlled traceability of the transactions; hiding the link between transaction inputs and the previous transactionsâ€™ outputs.

## Programs

* Generalizing virtual machine for on-chain and off-chain predicate evaluation.
* Support for arithmetic on homomorphically encrypted values (to improve confidentiality of on-chain programs).
* High-level programming language and formal verification toolkit.

## Scalability

* Reducing the amount of data to be stored by the nodes by requiring clients use more sophisticated proofs.
* More elaborate support for compact proofs to improve security of clients that do not validate the blockchain entirely.
* Additional support for merging blockchains.
