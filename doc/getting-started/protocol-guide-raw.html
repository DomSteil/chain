        <p>A blockchain consists of an immutable set of cryptographically linked transactions. Each transaction
          consists of one or more inputs and outputs. An input defines a source of asset units — either a new
          issuance, or existing asset units controlled by a control program in an output of a previous transaction. An
          output defines an amount of asset units from the inputs to be controlled by a new control program or
          retired. When an output is not retired and has not yet been used as an input to a new transaction, we refer
          to it as an unspent output.</p>
